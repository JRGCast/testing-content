# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
## Types os development:

### Sequential development:
1. Someone has an idea;
2. Says the requirements;
3. Design the application;
4. Build the application;
5. Test and fix the application;
6. Then releases;
   
- [x] It's called sequential because we don't start a new step before finishing the last one;
* It's not a good way because it's very benefical to have early feedbacks (Ex.: only getting the flaws in design when testing).

### Waterfall
* Similar to sequential, test activities only occurs after all other development activities have been completed.
- [x] It's the anciest model;

### V-Model
* It's an upgrade to the waterfall model. Goes all the 'way down' and, when coding, everything is tested on the 'way up';
- [x] Implements the principle of early testing by integration of the test process throughout development process (every phase of development is tested, from user requirements to design);

### Iterative & incremental
* Similar to Waterfall, but in bulks;
- [x] Incremental: we design, build and test one section before moving to another, we do everything in one section before moving;
- [x] Iterative: We divide our software in iterations. We can say that we divide the application development like 'layers' in a painting (first the sketch, then the first painting stroke, and then the details);

### Scrum 
* This model implements iterativa & incremental toghether;
- [x] We have a sprint (1-4 weeks);
- [x] We have a daily scrum meeting;
- [x] We have a sprint review and spring retrospective;
- [x] While there are requirements on sprint backlog, we repeat the above cycle;
